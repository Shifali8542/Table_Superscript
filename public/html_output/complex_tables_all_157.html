<p>Consumer loans comprised approximately 15% and 13% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit represent the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio. Such balances represented approximately 6% of total loans and leases at each of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Approximately 40% of home equity loans and lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2017 were secured by properties in New York State, 25% in Maryland, 21% in Pennsylvania and 3% in New Jersey. Outstanding automobile loan balances rose to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2017 from $2.9 billion at December 31, 2016. That increase reflects continued consumer demand for motor vehicles.</p>
