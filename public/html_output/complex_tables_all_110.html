<p>(a) Transfers into Level 3 are the result of unobservable inputs utilized within valuation methodologies for assets that were previously valued using observable inputs. Transfers out of Level 3 are due to the use of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as the utilization of pricing service information for certain assets that the Company is able to validate.</p>
<p>(b) Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net, represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period. Such activity primarily consists of purchases and sales of fixed maturity and equity securities and changes to embedded derivative instruments related to insurance products resulting from the issuance of new contracts, or changes to existing contracts.

<p>At December 31, 2017, 52 percent of our Level 3 fixed maturities, available for sale, were investment grade and 89 percent of our Level 3 fixed maturities, available for sale, consisted of corporate securities.</p>
<p>Realized and unrealized investment gains and losses presented in the preceding tables represent gains and losses during the time the applicable financial instruments were classified as Level 3.</p>
<p>Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on Level 3 assets are primarily reported in either net investment income for policyholder and other special-purpose portfolios, net realized investment gains (losses) or insurance policy benefits within the consolidated statement of operations or accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders&#x27; equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the instrument.</p>
<p>The amount presented for gains (losses) included in our net loss for assets and liabilities still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments for fixed maturities, available for sale, changes in fair value of trading securities and certain derivatives and changes in fair value of embedded derivative instruments included in liabilities for insurance products that exist as of the reporting date.</p>
<p>Investment ratings are assigned the second lowest rating by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (Moody&#x27;s, S&amp;P or Fitch), or if not rated by such firms, the rating assigned by the NAIC.
