<h2>Technologies Used in Preparation of Proved Reserves Estimates</h2>
<p>Estimates of reserves were prepared in compliance with SEC rules, regulations and guidance and SPE standards. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data and production history. For our properties, structure and isopach maps were constructed to delineate each reservoir. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, seismic data and other available data were used to prepare these maps. Parameters of area, porosity and water saturation were estimated and applied to the isopach maps to obtain estimates of original oil in place or original gas in place. For developed producing wells whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were determined using decline curve analysis. Reserves for producing wells whose performance was not yet established and for undeveloped locations were estimated using type curves. The parameters needed to develop these type curves such as initial decline rate, &quot;b&quot; factor and final decline rate were based on nearby wells producing from the same reservoir and with a similar completion for which more data were available.</p>
<h2>Reporting of NGLs</h2>
<p>We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. At December 31, 2017, NGLs represented approximately 32% of our total proved reserves on a Boe basis. NGLs are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGLs, we include these volumes and production as Boe. The prices we received for a standard barrel of NGLs in 2017 averaged approximately 61% lower than the average prices for equivalent volumes of oil. We report all production information related to natural gas net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Reports</h2>
<p>For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we engaged DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers, to prepare estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and gas properties, including 100% of our total reported proved reserves. DeGolyer and MacNaughton&#x27;s report for 2017 is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Oil and Gas Production, Production Prices and Production Costs</h2>
<p>The following table sets forth summary information regarding oil, NGLs and gas production, average sales prices and average production costs for the last three years. We determined the Boe using the ratio of six Mef of natural gas to one Boe, and one barrel of NGLs to one Boe. The ratios of six Mcf of natural gas to one Boe and one barrel of NGLs to one Boe do not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a Boe for natural gas or NGLs may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.</p>
