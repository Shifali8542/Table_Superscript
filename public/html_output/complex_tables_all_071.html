<p>N/A Not applicable.</p>
<p><sup>(1)</sup> On April 24, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an additional expenditure of up to $2.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through June 30, 2019. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means.</p>
<p>2) Includes restricted shares withheld pursuant to the terms of awards under the Company&#x27;s share-based compensation plans to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon vesting and release of restricted shares. The value of the restricted shares withheld is the closing price of common stock of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. on the date the relevant transaction occurs. Also includes shares withheld pursuant to the net settlement of Non-Qualified Stock Option (&quot;NQSO&quot;) exercises to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon exercise and to cover the strike price of the NOSO.
