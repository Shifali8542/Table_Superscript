<p>Net debt (defined as total debt excluding debt issuance costs, less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held for settlement of the 6.25% Notes) at December 31, 2017 was $177.2 million compared with $162.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase reflects the utilization of $15.3 million of cash in the settlement of our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities and tender of our 6.25% Notes, delayed cash receipts associated with the rural health care program and other changes in working capital.</p>
<h2>Other Initiatives</h2>
<p>During 2017 we continued expansion of our product and service offering. We also made significant progress with our managed IT services partnerships, including Microsoft where we are enhancing our cloud solution capabilities. In addition, our North Slope network partner, Quintillion, turned up service this year.</p>
<p>We successfully completed trials of our new fixed wireless technology and expect to use it extensively in meeting our CAF II obligations. We also see application in more urban markets, giving us a competitive network for consumer and small business customers.</p>
<p>We entered into an agreement to procure transponder space in a C-Band satellite. We have traditionally leased capacity from other providers, and this will create significant savings for us beginning in 2018 as we migrate to our own network, while providing additional capacity.</p>
<h2>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>The following tables summarize our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Revenue information reflects the organization of revenue streams described in &quot;Revenue Sources by Customer Group&quot; above. All amounts are discussed at the consolidated level after the elimination of affiliate revenue and expense. Results in 2015 reflect the sale and wind-down of our Wireless operations beginning in the first quarter.</p>
