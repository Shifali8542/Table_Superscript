<p>Segment expenses include specific expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers; selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities; and certain allocated expenses which include network expenses, facilities expenses and other expenses, such as vehicle and real estate-related expenses. We do not assign depreciation and amortization expense, goodwill impairment, merger, integration and other costs, restructuring charges, share-based compensation and pension costs to our segments, because these expenses are centrally managed and are not monitored by or reported to the chief operating decision maker (&quot;CODM&quot;) by segment. Similarly, certain costs related to centrally-managed administrative functions, such as accounting and finance, information technology, network management, legal and human resources, are not assigned to our segments. Interest expense and net loss on early extinguishment of debt have also been excluded from segment operating results because we manage our financing activities on a total company basis and have not assigned any long-term debt obligations to the segments. Amounts related to our investment in Uniti common stock consisting of dividend income, net gain on disposal and other-than-temporary impairment loss, as well as other (expense) income, net, and income tax benefit are not monitored as a part of our segment operations and, therefore, these items also have been excluded from our segment operating results.</p>
<p>See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of total segment revenues and sales to consolidated revenues and sales and segment income to consolidated net loss.</p>

<p>(a) The decrease in high-speed Internet bundle revenues in 2017 was primarily due to the overall decline in customers served as further discussed below. Conversely, the increase in these revenues in 2016 was primarily due to the continued migration of customers to higher speeds and the effects of targeted price increases, partially offset by declines in high-speed Internet customers. Demand for faster broadband speeds are expected to favorably impact consumer high- speed Internet revenues, offsetting some of the decline in consumer voice revenues.</p>
<p>(b) The decreases in voice-only revenues were primarily attributable to declines in households served further discussed below.</p>
<p>(c) The decreases were primarily attributable to lower usage for voice-only and high-speed Internet services and declines in customers due to the impacts of competition.</p>
<p>(d) Switched access revenues include usage sensitive revenues from long-distance companies and other carriers for access to our network in connection with the completion of long-distance calls, as well as reciprocal compensation received from wireless and other local connecting carriers for use of our network facilities. The decreases were primarily due to the effects of inter-carrier compensation reform. See &quot;Regulatory Matters&quot; for a further discussion.</p>
