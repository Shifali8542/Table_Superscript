<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The Company records losses for claims in excess of the limits of, or outside the coverage of, applicable insurance at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC Topic 450-Contingencies, the Company accrues anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based upon historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, the Company expenses these costs as incurred. If the best estimate of a probable loss is a range rather than a specific amount, the Company accrues the amount at the lower end of the range.</p>
<p>The Company&#x27;s accruals for legal matters that were probable and estimable were not material at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could adversely impact the Company&#x27;s operating results, cash flows and overall liquidity. The Company maintains third- party insurance policies to provide coverage for certain legal claims, in an effort to mitigate its overall exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, as (i) one or more of the Company&#x27;s insurance carriers could take the position that portions of these claims are not covered by the Company&#x27;s insurance, (ii) to the extent that payments are made to resolve claims and lawsuits, applicable insurance policy limits are eroded and (iii) the claims and lawsuits relating to these matters are continuing to develop, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by unfavorable resolutions of these matters. Based upon the AM Best Company ratings of these third-party insurers, management does not believe there is a substantial risk of an insurer&#x27;s material non-performance related to any current insured claims.</p>
<p>On the basis of current information, the availability of insurance and legal advice, in management&#x27;s opinion, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations and/or cash flows.</p>
