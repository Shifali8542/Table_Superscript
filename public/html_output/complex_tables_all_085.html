<h2>Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016</h2>
<h2>Operating Revenue</h2>
<h2>Business and Wholesale</h2>
<p>Business and wholesale revenue of $139.1 million increased $2.2 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 from $136.9 million in 2016. This improvement was primarily driven by a $2.3 million increase from new and existing customers buying or increasing their consumption of bandwidth using our advanced network services such as MPLS, dedicated Internet and Enhanced Metro Ethernet. Business broadband ARPU drove overall revenue growth and reflects customer demand for increasing amount of bandwidth. Business broadband ARPU increased to $334.36 in 2017 from $322.80 in 2016, or 3.6%, and Business broadband connections of 15,293 in 2017 increased marginally from 15,239 in 2016. Wholesale broadband revenue increased $4.5 million and Managed IT services revenue increased $0.1 million year over year. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in voice and other revenue due primarily to 4,470 fewer business and wholesale voice connections year over year. Business voice ARPU of $23.39 in 2017 declined marginally compared with $23.45 in 2016. Equipment sales and installations declined $2.0 million year over year. While connections and ARPU serve as data points to support the analysis of period-over-period changes in revenue, they are not critical indicators utilized by the Company to manage the Business and Wholesale customer group.</p>
<h2>Consumer</h2>
<p>Consumer revenue of $37.1 million decreased $0.6 million, or 1.7%, in 2017 from $37.7 million in 2016. Broadband revenue increased $0.4 million to $25.4 million in 2017 from $25.0 million in 2016 due to an increase in ARPU to $61.24 from $60.73, largely offset by a 699 decline in connections year over year. Voice and other revenue decreased $1.1 million primarily due to 4,156 fewer connections, partially offset by an increase in ARPU to $29.88 from $28.71 in the prior year. The downward trend in voice connections is expected to continue as more customers discontinue using their fixed landline voice service and move to wireless alternatives.</p>
