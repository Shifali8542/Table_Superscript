<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">(a) We calculate benefit ratios by dividing the related product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">(b) We calculate the interest-adjusted benefit ratio (a non-GAAP measure) for Washington National&#x27;s supplemental health products by dividing such product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits less the imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities by policy income. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company&#x27;s performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">These non-GAAP financial measures of &quot;interest-adjusted benefit ratios&quot; differ from &quot;benefit ratios&quot; due to the deduction of imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities from the product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits used to determine the ratio. Interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of health products that are expected to be inforce for a longer duration of time, are not subject to unilateral changes in provisions (such as non-cancelable or guaranteed renewable contracts) and require the performance of various functions and services (including insurance protection) for an extended period of time. The net cash flows from supplemental health products generally cause an accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (accounted for as reserve increases) that will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (accounted for as reserve decreases). Accordingly, as the policies age, the benefit ratio will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by the imputed interest income earned on the accumulated assets. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio reflects the effects of such interest income offset (which is equal to the tabular interest on the related insurance liabilities). Since interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of these products, management believes a benefit ratio that includes the effect of interest income is useful in analyzing product performance. We utilize the interest-adjusted benefit ratio in measuring segment performance because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and trends in the business. However, the &quot;interest- adjusted benefit ratio&quot; does not replace the &quot;benefit ratio&quot; as a measure of current period benefits to current period insurance policy income. Accordingly, management reviews both &quot;benefit ratios&quot; and &quot;interest-adjusted benefit ratios&quot; when analyzing the financial results attributable to these products. The imputed investment income earned on the accumulated assets backing the supplemental health reserves was $141.7 million, $135.6 million and $132.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">Total premium collections were $671.6 million in 2017, up 1.9 percent from 2016, and $659.3 million in 2016, up 1.5 percent from 2015, driven by sales and persistency of the segment&#x27;s supplemental health block; partially offset by lower Medicare supplement collected premiums due to the run-off of this block of business. This segment no longer markets Medicare supplement products and no longer actively pursues sales of annuity products. See &quot;Premium Collections&quot; for further analysis of fluctuations in premiums collected by product.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded were $4,012.9 million in 2017, up 1.5 percent from 2016, and $3,954.6 million in 2016, up 1.2 percent from 2015, reflecting an increase in the supplemental health block; partially offset by the run-off of the annuity blocks.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10.0px; font-family: TimesNewRoman, serif; color: #000000">Insurance policy income is comprised of premiums earned on traditional insurance policies which provide mortality or morbidity coverage and fees and other charges assessed on other policies. Such income increased in recent periods as supplemental health premiums have increased consistent with sales; partially offset by the decrease in Medicare supplement premiums.</p>
