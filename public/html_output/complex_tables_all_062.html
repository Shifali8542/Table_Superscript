<h2>Clear Aligner Segment</h2>
<h2>Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment</h2>
<p>Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the population. Annually, approximately 10 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. Of the 10 million annual orthodontic cases started, approximately 60% or 6 million are applicable to Invisalign treatment - our served market. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth, but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor&#x27;s office. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.</p>
<h2>The Invisalign System</h2>
<p>The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic, removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases:</p>
<p>Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient&#x27;s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a polyvinyl-siloxane (or &quot;PVS&quot;) impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional&#x27;s election, x-rays of the patient&#x27;s dentition. The Invisalign-trained dental professional can also submit an intraoral digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression through either Align&#x27;s iTero scanner or several third-party scanners. See &quot;Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission.&quot; More than 50% of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression.</p>
<p>Preparation of computer-simulated treatment plan. Using propriety software which we do not sell, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan. The ClinCheck treatment plan simulates appropriate tooth movement in stages and details timing and placement of any features or attachments that will be used during treatment. Attachments are tooth-colored &quot;buttons&quot; that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement.</p>
<p>Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisalign provider. The patient&#x27;s ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets. By reviewing, modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan, the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan.</p>
<p>Manufacture of custom aligners. Upon the dental professional&#x27;s approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan, we use the data underlying the simulation, in conjunction with stereolithography technology (a form of 3D printing technology), to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient&#x27;s teeth. Each mold is a replica of the patient&#x27;s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment. From these molds, aligners are fabricated by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each</p>
