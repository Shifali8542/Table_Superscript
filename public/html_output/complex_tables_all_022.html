<h2>Apollo value-add</h2>
<p>路 Significant Synergy Opportunities. Due to the fact that Henry&#x27;s and Sprouts were nearly identical concepts with minimal geographic overlap, the combination presented meaningful opportunities for significant cost savings and synergies including buying leverage due to increased scale, distribution and warehousing efficiencies, the implementation of best-practices, reduced marketing spend, and elimination of duplicative corporate overhead.</p>
<p>路 Upgrading of the Financial Team. The Apollo team assisted the company with recruiting the financial team at Sprouts through the identification and recruitment of a new Chief Financial Officer, who had significant prior experience in driving the financial organization of a sponsor-backed company that went through the process of building the internal systems and controls to become a publicly-traded company.</p>
<p>路 Platform for Add-on Acquisitions. In addition to Sprouts&#x27; strong organic and new store growth prospects, the team believed there were other highly complementary acquisition opportunities in the natural / organic grocery segment. The Apollo team assisted with the identification, negotiation and financing of the accretive Sunflower acquisition by Sprouts in May 2012.</p>
<p>路 Capital Markets Expertise. Prior to the transaction, Sprouts had never raised syndicated debt financing in the capital markets. The Apollo team worked closely with Sprouts to help secure the acquisition financing with very attractive terms, including a term loan with no maintenance covenants and significant financial flexibility. In April 2013, the Apollo team helped Sprouts raise a $700 million term loan B at an overall yield of 4.625%. The proceeds were used to refinance existing debt and fund a distribution to equity holders, which resulted in $122 million in proceeds to Fund VI, or approximately 67% of the original equity investment. In addition, Apollo helped the company position itself for its IPO. Several pre-IPO store tours and information sessions were hosted with large equity mutual fund institutional accounts across the country as well as with prominent equity research analysts.</p>
<p>. Leveraging of Apollo&#x27;s Food Retail Experience. Apollo has a long track record of successfully investing in food retail businesses and was able to provide strategic direction and perspectives from outside of the &quot;farmers market&quot; niche to management and the board of directors. One area of focus was to help Sprouts refine its decision making and ROI criteria in evaluating new store opportunities.</p>
