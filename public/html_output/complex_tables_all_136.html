<p>Assets in the U.S. equities category include investments in common and preferred stocks (and equivalents such as American Depository Receipts and convertible bonds) and may be held through separate accounts, commingled funds or an institutional mutual fund. Assets in the international equities category include investments in a broad range of international equity securities, including both developed and emerging markets, and may be held through a commingled or institutional mutual fund. The real estate category includes investments in pooled and commingled funds whose objectives are diversified equity investments in income-producing properties. Each real estate fund is intended to provide broad exposure to the real estate market by property type, geographic location and size and may invest internationally. Securities in both the aggregate and core plus fixed income categories include U.S. government, corporate, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and Yankee bonds, and both categories target an average credit rating of &quot;A&quot; or better at all times. Individual securities in the aggregate fixed income category must be investment grade or above at the time of purchase, whereas securities in the core plus category may have a rating of &quot;B&quot; or above. Additionally, the core plus category may invest in non-U.S. securities. Assets in the aggregate and core plus fixed income categories are held primarily through a commingled fund and an institutional mutual fund, respectively. Group annuity contracts are invested in a combination of equity, real estate, bond and other investments in connection with a pension plan in Norway.</p>
