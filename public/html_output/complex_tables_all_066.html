<h2>Regulatory</h2>
<h2>Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products</h2>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>Our current and contemplated activities, and the products and processes that result from such activities, are subject to substantial government regulation. Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. Clinical trial programs must determine an appropriate dose and regimen, establish substantial evidence of effectiveness and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the product must successfully meet pre-specified endpoints.</p>
<p>Pre-Clinical Testing: Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the U.S., stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation.</p>
<p>Investigational New Drug Exemption: Pre-clinical testing results obtained from in vivo studies in several animal species, as well as from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA, as part of an IND, and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers.</p>
<p>Clinical Trials: Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, depending upon the nature of the clinical program, a specific phase or phases may be skipped altogether. Clinical trials must</p>

<p>be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.</p>
<p>. Phase 1 clinical trials-test for safety, dose tolerability, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, to gain early evidence regarding efficacy.</p>
<p>. Phase 2 clinical trials-involve a relatively small sample of the actual intended patient population and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications, to determine dose-response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.</p>
<p>. Phase 3 clinical trials-consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (&quot;BLA&quot;), or an NDA. The NDA or BLA also includes information pertaining to the preparation of the product, analytical methods, details of the manufacture of finished products and proposed product packaging and labeling. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application if it is not considered sufficiently complete to permit a review and will inform the applicant of the reason for the refusal. The applicant may then resubmit the application and include the supplemental information.</p>
