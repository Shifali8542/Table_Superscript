<h2>Post-retirement Health Benefit Plan</h2>
<p>The Company has a separate executive post-retirement health benefit plan. On December 31, 2017, the plan was underfunded by $330 with plan assets of $59. The net periodic post-retirement cost for 2017 and 2016 was $15 and $12, respectively.</p>
<h2>14. EARNINGS PER SHARE</h2>
<p>Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common share equivalents outstanding. Basic earnings per share assumes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to Alaska Communications by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company. The Company reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017. Therefore, 3,022 potential common share equivalents were anti-dilutive and excluded from the calculation.</p>
