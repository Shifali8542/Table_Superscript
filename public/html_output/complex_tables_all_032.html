<p>CUSHMAN &amp; WAKEFIELD</p>
<p>Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is a global leader in real estate services with more than 48,000 employees serving clients in over 70 countries. Core services include property and facilities management, investment and asset management and a range of brokerage services including leasing, capital markets and valuation.</p>
<p>Investment Summary . 2Q18</p>
<h2>Recent Results and Initiatives</h2>
<p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield&#x27;s positive momentum from 4Q17 continued into 1Q18 with revenue growth over the prior corresponding period remaining above 10%. The strong performance was broad based with Americas (+10% over prior year), EMEA (+25% over prior year) and APAC (+17% over prior year) all achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior corresponding period.</p>
<p>On an EBITDA basis, the 1Q18 results exhibited strong margin expansion as the Phase 2 cost- out program initiated in 3Q17 began to deliver meaningful realized savings. Together with the flow through impact of higher revenue, the cost savings resulted in a significant uplift in EBITDA over the prior corresponding period with 1Q18 EBITDA up approximately 200% and 1Q18 LTM EBITDA up approximately 20%.</p>
<p>While it is important to note that 1H - and 1Q in particular - are the seasonally smallest periods for the industry, the strong momentum and outperformance against both the prior corresponding period and the 2018 Budget is pleasing and positions the Company well for the remainder of 2018.</p>
<p>The company continues to have good traction with infill M&amp;A with a robust pipeline in place encompassing a variety of geographies and service lines and multiple transactions currently in progress. Given the slower than expected ramp-up in acquired brokers, management continues to prioritize M&amp;A (which is immediately accretive).</p>

<p>1. Valuation EBITDA reflects FY18 Forecast consistent with public market reporting</p>
<p>2. Valuation net debt includes deferred consideration associated with M&amp;A and broker recruiting</p>
<p>3. Key Comps: JLL and CBRE</p>
<h2>Commentary</h2>
<p>At 2Q18, TPG marked its investment in Cushman &amp; Wakefield at 10.0x CY18F EBITDA, implying a valuation of 1.7x, consistent with 1Q18.</p>
<p>Due to the level of unusual items impacting 2017, TPG primarily looked to forward multiples, although LTM multiples were used as a cross-check. The valuation multiple is 10.0x on a EV/FWD EBITDA basis, which is a slight discount to the key peers, CBRE and JLL, which are currently trading at an average of 10.5x. The CY18E EBITDA estimate has been updated to reflect public company reporting which includes the add-back of non-cash broker amortization and reflects the impact of ASC 606 (Revenue Recognition) accounting changes.</p>
<p>On an LTM basis, the valuation implies a multiple of 9.0x Adjusted EBITDA (including actioned but unrealized cost synergies and the run-rate impact of completed M&amp;A), a meaningful discount to the key peers which are trading at an average of 10.6x.</p>
