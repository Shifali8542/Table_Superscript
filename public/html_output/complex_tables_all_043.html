<p>Impella product revenue encompasses Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella RP and Impella AIC product sales. Service and other revenue represents revenue earned on service maintenance contracts and preventative maintenance calls. Other product revenue includes AB5000 and product accessory revenue.</p>
<p>Total revenue for fiscal 2017 increased $115.8 million, or 35%, to $445.3 million from $329.5 million for fiscal 2016. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to increased Impella product revenue from increased utilization in the U.S. and Germany. Impella product revenue was higher as a result of recent PMA approvals in the U.S. in March 2015 for elective and high risk PCI procedures for Impella 2.5 and in April 2016 for cardiogenic shock for Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD and in December 2016, to add Impella CP device for use in elective and high risk procedures.</p>
