<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA of $56.7 million in 2017 decreased $1.5 million, or 2.6%, from $58.2 million in 2016 due primarily to marginally higher operating expenses, including an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with rural health accounts in 2017. See &quot;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&quot; for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net (Loss) Income. As discussed in &quot;Non-GAAP Financial Measures,&quot; the Company does not provide a reconciliation of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to Net (Loss) Income.</p>
<h2>Operating Metrics</h2>
<p>Business broadband average monthly revenue per user (&quot;ARPU&quot;) of $334.36 in 2017 increased from $322.80 in 2016. Business broadband connections of 15,293 at December 31, 2017, increased marginally from connections of 15,239 at December 31, 2016. We count connections on a unitary basis regardless of the size of the bandwidth. For example, a customer that has a 10MB connection is counted as one connection as is a customer with a 1MB connection. While we present metrics related to Business connections, we note that we manage Business and wholesale in terms of new Monthly Recurring Charges (&quot;MRC&quot;) sold. Achievement of sales performance in terms of MRC is the primary operating metric used by management to measure market performance. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose our sales or performance in MRC.</p>
<p>Consumer broadband connections of 33,904 were down marginally year over year and consumer broadband ARPU of $60.72 in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined marginally from $61.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>The table below provides certain key operating metrics as of, or for, the periods indicated.</p>

<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>We generated cash from operating activities of $30.4 million in 2017 compared with $37.2 million in 2016. This decline was due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable, including those associated with certain rural health care customers.</p>
<p>In 2017, we invested a total of $32.9 million of cash in capital, including capitalized interest and net of the settlement of items accrued in previous periods.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2017 we entered into the 2017 Senior Credit Facility and the settled our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities. This transaction extends our senior debt maturities to 2022 and 2023 and provided funding for the tender, repurchase or settlement at maturity of our 6.25% Notes due in 2018. In the second quarter of 2017 we completed the tender offer and settled the 6.25% Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $84.0 million.</p>
