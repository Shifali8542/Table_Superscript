<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>We generate revenue principally from search and display advertising on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites, with the majority of our revenue coming from advertising on Yahoo Properties. Our margins on revenue from advertising on Yahoo Properties are higher than our margins on revenue from advertising on Affiliate sites, as we pay TAC to our Affiliates. Additionally, we generate revenue from other sources including listings-based services, e-commerce transactions, royalties, patent licenses, and consumer and business fee-based services.</p>

To conform to the current presentation, we reclassified $29.7 million and $11.6 million to search and display revenue, respectively, previously included in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, and we reclassified $39.1 million and $12.1 million to search and display revenue, respectively, previously included in other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.</p>

A Paid Click occurs when an end-user clicks on a sponsored listing on Yahoo Properties or Affiliate sites for which an advertiser pays on a per click basis. In October 2015, we reached an agreement with Google that provides us with additional flexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads. Google&#x27;s offerings complement the search services provided by Microsoft and Yahoo Gemini. We are considered the principal in the sale of traffic to Microsoft (in markets that have transitioned pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search</p>
