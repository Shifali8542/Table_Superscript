<p>Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset. The increase in the valuation allowance from 2016 to 2017 relates to deferred tax assets recorded in certain entities acquired as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. Abbott does not believe that it is more likely than not that the benefits of these deferred tax assets will be realized.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled:</p>
