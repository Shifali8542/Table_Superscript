<h2>COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016</h2>
<p>Net revenue was $841.0 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, representing a decrease of $275.8 million, or 24.7%, as compared to net revenue of $1,116.8 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net revenue in the period was primarily due to $279.1 million decline in organic revenue. The $279.1 million decline in organic revenue was due to approximately $192 million and $87 million declines in volume and price erosion, respectively. The organic revenue decline was principally due to the effect of competition on Ephedrine Sulfate Injection, as well as Lidocaine Ointment. Additionally, other key products, such as Progesterone and Clobetasol Ointment, experienced more significant than expected declines in net revenue as a result of increased competition consistent with observed industry trends in 2017. In addition, the Company experienced more than normal supply disruptions for certain products during the year, resulting in lower net revenue. While the Company received 26 new-to-Akorn ANDA product approvals and launched 21 new products during 2017, it was unable to offset the overall net revenue decline through new product launches or new business opportunities.</p>
