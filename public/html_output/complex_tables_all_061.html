<p>The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In performing its analysis of whether a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax asset was necessary, the Company evaluated the data and determined that as of December 31, 2014 it could not conclude that it was more likely than not that certain of the net operating losses of its Indian and Swiss subsidiaries would be realized. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of $10.5 million, $9.9 million and $8.8 million against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
<p>The deferred tax balances have been reflected gross on the balance sheet and are netted only if they are in the same jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Company&#x27;s net operating loss (&quot;NOL&quot;) carry-forwards as of December 31, 2017 consist of three component pieces: (i) U.S. Federal NOL carry-forwards valued at $3.7 million, (ii) foreign (Indian) NOLs of $21.0 million and (iii) foreign (Swiss) NOLs of $0.4 million. The U.S. Federal NOL carry-forwards were obtained through the Merck Acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Indian NOL carry-forwards relate to operating losses by the Company&#x27;s subsidiary in India, which was acquired in 2012. Of the $21.0 million Indian NOL, $10.1 million expires beginning in 2022; the Company has established a valuation allowance against this entire amount. The remaining $10.9 million of the Indian NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely, and the Company has concluded that they are more likely than not to be utilized and therefore has not established a valuation allowance against them. The Swiss NOL was obtained through the Akorn AG acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2015. It begins to expire in 2023 and, accordingly, the Company has established a valuation allowance against the entire amount.</p>
<p>The Company is currently undergoing an examination of its Federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2015 by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company&#x27;s U.S. Federal income tax returns filed for years 2014 through 2016 are open for examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The majority of the Company&#x27;s state and local income tax returns filed for years 2014 through 2016 remain open for examination as well.</p>
