<p>(a) We calculate benefit ratios by dividing the related product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits by insurance policy income.</p>
<p>(b) We calculate the interest-adjusted benefit ratio (a non-GAAP measure) for Bankers Life&#x27;s long-term care products by dividing such product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits less the imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities by policy income. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP measure is a numerical measure of a company&#x27;s performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p>These non-GAAP financial measures of &quot;interest-adjusted benefit ratios&quot; differ from &quot;benefit ratios&quot; due to the deduction of imputed interest income on the accumulated assets backing the insurance liabilities from the product&#x27;s insurance policy benefits used to determine the ratio. Interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of health products that are expected to be inforce for a longer duration of time, are not subject to unilateral changes in provisions (such as non-cancelable or guaranteed renewable contracts) and require the performance of various functions and services (including insurance protection) for an extended period of time. The net cash flows from long-term care products generally cause an accumulation of amounts in the early years of a policy (accounted for as reserve increases) that will be paid out as benefits in later policy years (accounted for as reserve decreases). Accordingly, as the policies age, the benefit ratio will typically increase, but the increase in benefits will be partially offset by the imputed interest income earned on the accumulated assets. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio reflects the effects of such interest income offset (which is equal to the tabular interest on the related insurance liabilities). Since interest income is an important factor in measuring the performance of this product, management believes a benefit ratio that includes the effect of interest income is useful in analyzing product performance. We utilize the interest-adjusted benefit ratio in measuring segment performance because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and trends in the business. However, the &quot;interest-adjusted benefit ratio&quot; does not replace the &quot;benefit ratio&quot; as a measure of current period benefits to current period insurance policy income. Accordingly, management reviews both &quot;benefit ratios&quot; and &quot;interest-adjusted benefit ratios&quot; when analyzing the financial results attributable to these products. The imputed investment income earned on the accumulated assets backing Bankers Life&#x27;s long-term care reserves was $276.8 million, $274.7 million and $271.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
<p>Total premium collections were $2,706.4 million in 2017, up 1.5 percent from 2016, and $2,666.4 million in 2016, up 7.0 percent from 2015. See &quot;Premium Collections&quot; for further analysis of Bankers Life&#x27;s premium collections.</p>
<p>Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded were $15.6 billion in 2017, up 2.9 percent from 2016 and $15.2 billion in 2016, up 2.5 percent from 2015. Such average insurance liabilities for certain long-term care products were increased by $107 million, $184 million and $196 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reflect the premium deficiencies that would exist if unrealized gains on the assets backing such products had been realized and the proceeds from the sales of such assets were invested at then current yields. Such increase is reflected as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned item, the increase in average liabilities for insurance products was primarily due to new sales and the amounts added to policyholder account balances on interest-sensitive products.</p>
<p>Insurance policy income is comprised of premiums earned on policies which provide mortality or morbidity coverage and fees and other charges assessed on other policies.</p>
