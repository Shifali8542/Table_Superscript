<p>Investment Summary . 2Q18</p>
<h2>Recent Results and Initiatives</h2>
<p>In 1Q18 revenues were up +9.5% over prior year, driven by new locations ramping and growth in membership dues. Adjusted EBITDA was up +10.9% over prior year. Same store sales continued to be positive with 1Q18 37-month SSS +1.5% over prior year.</p>
<p>The Company has opened 7 new locations in YTD 2018 (June) and is scheduled to open a total of 12 new locations in 2018. Additionally, Life Time has identified 12+ locations for 2019 openings. Recently-opened clubs have been ramping well and meeting or exceeded our return-on-invested-capital targets.</p>
<p>In April, the Company opened the first Life Time Works co-working space at its new club in Ardmore, PA. The concept is off to a strong start and we are working with management to evaluate additional locations.</p>
<p>Top priorities for the year include efficiently executing the new location pipeline for 2018 and 2019, driving positive same store sales in mature clubs, and keeping a strong focus on operating margins.</p>
