<p>We incur significant operating costs in Ireland and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the Euro arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled in Euro. The impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the Euro on our USD denominated revenues earned in countries other than the U.S. is partially offset by the opposite impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the Euro on operating expenses and payables incurred at our Irish operations that are settled in Euro. For the year ended December 31, 2017, an average 10% weakening in the USD relative to the Euro would have resulted in an increase to our expenses denominated in Euro of approximately $6.9 million.</p>

<p>All financial statements required to be filed hereunder, other than the quarterly financial data required by Item 302 of Regulation S-K summarized above, are filed as exhibits hereto, are listed under Item 15(a) (1) and (2), and are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<h2>Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure</h2>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<h2>Item 9A. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<h2>Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>Controls and Procedures</p>
<p>Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2017. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#x27;s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p>Management&#x27;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</p>
<p>Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer&#x27;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer&#x27;s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with</p>
