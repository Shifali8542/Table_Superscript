<p>(a) The Company has outstanding Class J LP Units, which convert into Class E LP Units and ultimately become exchangeable into Class A Shares on a one-for-one basis. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Class J LP Units were dilutive and consequently the effect of their exchange into Class A Shares has been included in the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Inc. common shareholders under the if-converted method. In computing this adjustment, the Company assumes that all Class J LP Units are converted into Class A Shares.</p>
<p>(b) The Company also has outstanding Class A and E LP Units in Evercore LP, which give the holders the right to receive Class A Shares upon exchange on a one-for-one basis. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Class A and E LP Units were antidilutive and consequently the effect of their exchange into Class A Shares has been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Inc. common shareholders. The units that would have been included in the denominator of the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to Evercore Inc. common shareholders if the effect would have been dilutive were 5,920, 6,397 and 6,606 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adjustment to the numerator, diluted net income attributable to Class A common shareholders, if the effect would have been dilutive, would have been $28,186, $18,196 and $7,697 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In computing this adjustment, the Company assumes that all vested Class A LP Units and all Class E LP Units are converted into Class A Shares, that all earnings attributable to those shares are attributed to Evercore Inc. and, that it has adopted a conventional corporate tax structure and is taxed as a C</p>
