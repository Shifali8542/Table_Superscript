<h2>Medical Market</h2>
<h2>Revenues for Medical Market Segment</h2>
<p>During fiscal 2017, total revenues in the medical market decreased by 3%, or $1.2 million, as compared to fiscal 2016. The change in the medical market segment was primarily attributable to the following:</p>
<p>· Total revenues from Piccolo chemistry analyzers decreased by 38%, or $3.9 million, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily attributable to (a) a decrease in the unit sales of Piccolo chemistry analyzers sold in North America to Abbott, (b) a decrease in revenues from Piccolo chemistry analyzers sold to various distributors in Europe and (c) the impact of sales of Piccolo chemistry analyzers to Fuzhou Kelian Medical Devices, Ltd., a point-of-care diagnostics distributor based in China, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>· Total revenues from medical reagent discs increased by 10%, or $2.6 million, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily attributable to an increase in the sales volume of medical reagent discs sold in North America to Abbott, resulting from an expanded installed base of Piccolo chemistry analyzers.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit for Medical Market Segment</h2>
<p>Gross profit for the medical market segment decreased by 5%, or $0.9 million, during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Gross profit percentages for the medical market segment during fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 46% and 47%, respectively. In absolute dollars, the net decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a decrease in the unit sales of Piccolo chemistry analyzers, partially offset an increase in the unit sales of medical reagent discs.</p>
