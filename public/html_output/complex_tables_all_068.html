<h2>Research and Development Expenses</h2>
<p>For each of its R&amp;D programs, the Company incurs both external and internal expenses. External R&amp;D expenses include costs related to clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, consulting fees, laboratory services, purchases of drug product materials and third-party manufacturing development costs. Internal R&amp;D expenses include employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, depreciation and general overhead. The Company tracks external R&amp;D expenses for each of its development programs, however, internal R&amp;D expenses, with the exception of those expenses related to BIIB098, are not tracked by individual program as they benefit multiple programs or its technologies in general.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative (&quot;SG&amp;A&quot;) expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related expenses associated with sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs.</p>
<p>Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, advertising costs totaled $34.4 million, $24.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively.</p>
<h2>Share-Based Compensation</h2>
<p>The Company&#x27;s share-based compensation programs grant awards which include stock options and restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), which vest with the passage of time and, to a limited extent, vest based on the achievement of certain performance criteria. The Company issues new shares upon stock option exercise or the vesting of RSUs. Certain of the Company&#x27;s employees are retirement eligible under the terms of the Company&#x27;s stock option plans (the &quot;Plans&quot;), and stock option awards to these employees generally vest in full upon retirement. Since there are no effective future service requirements for these employees, the fair value of these awards is expensed in full on the grant date or upon meeting the retirement eligibility criteria, whichever is later.</p>
<h2>Stock Options</h2>
<p>Stock option grants to employees expire ten years from the grant date and generally vest one-fourth per year over four years from the anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains continuously employed with the Company, except as otherwise provided in the plan. Stock option grants to directors are for ten-year terms and generally vest over a one-year period provided the director continues to serve on the Company&#x27;s board of directors through the vesting date, except as otherwise provided in the plan. The estimated fair value of options is recognized over the</p>

<p>requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>The fair value of stock option grants is based on estimates as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Company uses historical data as the basis for estimating option terms and forfeitures. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical stock option exercise and forfeiture behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The ranges of expected terms disclosed below reflect different expected behavior among certain groups of employees. Expected stock volatility factors are based on a weighted average of implied volatilities from traded options on the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares and historical share price volatility of the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares, which is determined based on a review of the weighted average of historical daily price changes of the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares. The risk-free interest rate for periods commensurate with the expected term of the share option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield on the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares is estimated to be zero as the Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends. The exercise price of options granted is equal to the closing price of the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market on the date of grant.</p>
<p>The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date with the following weighted-average assumptions:</p>
