<h2>Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units</h2>
<p>In February 2017, the board of directors approved awards of performance-based restricted stock units (&quot;PRSUs&quot;) to all employees employed by the Company during 2017, in each case subject to vesting on the achievement of two future key milestones in the Company&#x27;s clinical-stage pipeline and the achievement of a revenue-related goal; provided that, if any such vesting event occurs during the first year after grant, the vesting of the PRSU award will not occur until the one-year anniversary of the grant date. The award will expire if the performance conditions have not been met on or before the three-year anniversary of the grant date.</p>
<p>A summary of PRSU activity is presented in the following table:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>Number of Shares</th>
		<th>Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Unvested, January 1, 2017</td>
		<td>—</td>
		<td>$ —</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Granted</td>
		<td>1,169,949</td>
		<td>$ 54.73</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Forfeited</td>
		<td>(60,700)</td>
		<td>$ 54.78</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Unvested, December 31, 2017</td>
		<td>1,108,653</td>
		<td>$ 54.72</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The grant date fair value of the PRSUs was equal to the market value of the Company&#x27;s stock on the date of grant. At December 31, 2017, the Company does not consider it probable that the performance criteria will be met and has not recognized any share- based compensation expense related to these PRSUs. At December 31, 2017, there was $60.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to these PRSUs, which would be recognized in accordance with the terms of the award when the Company deems it probable that the performance criteria will be met.</p>

<p>The Company&#x27;s significant collaborative arrangements are described below:</p>
<p>Janssen</p>
<h2>INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA</h2>
<p>Under its license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., the Company granted Janssen a worldwide exclusive license under its NanoCrystal technology to develop, commercialize and manufacture INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and related products.</p>
<p>Under this license agreement, the Company received milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development goals from Janssen; there are no further milestones to be earned under this agreement. The Company receives tiered royalty payments between 5% and 9% of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA end-market net sales in each country where the license is in effect, with the exact royalty percentage determined based on aggregate worldwide net sales. The tiered royalty payments consist of a patent royalty and a know-how royalty, both of which are determined on a country-by-country basis. The patent royalty, which equals 1.5% of net sales, is payable in each country until the expiration of the last of the patents claiming the product in such country. The know-how royalty is a tiered royalty of 3.5%, 5.5% and 7.5% on aggregate worldwide net sales of below $250 million, between $250 million and $500 million, and greater than $500 million, respectively. The know-how royalty is payable for the later of 15 years from first commercial sale of a product in each individual country or March 31, 2019, subject in each case to the expiry of the license agreement. These royalty payments may be reduced in any country based on patent litigation or on competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement expires upon the later of (i) March 31, 2019 or (ii) the expiration of the last of the patents subject to the agreement. After expiration, Janssen retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the products.</p>
<p>Janssen may terminate the license agreement in whole or in part upon three months&#x27; notice to the Company. The Company and Janssen have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the other party, which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party&#x27;s bankruptcy or insolvency.</p>
<p>Under its agreements with Janssen, the Company recognized royalty revenues from the end-market net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA of $214.9 million, $184.2 million and $149.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
