<p>This segment&#x27;s results are significantly impacted by the accounting standard related to deferred acquisition costs. We are not able to defer most of Colonial Penn&#x27;s direct response advertising costs although such costs generate predictable sales and future inforce profits. We plan to continue to invest in this segment&#x27;s business, including the development of new products and markets. The amount of our investment in new business during a particular period will have a significant impact on this segment&#x27;s results. We expect this segment to report earnings (before net realized investment gains (losses) and income taxes) in 2018 in the range of $10 million to $20 million, but because of the seasonality of advertising spend, we expect a loss in the range of $1 million to $3 million in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Total premium collections increased 4.1 percent, to $291.6 million, in 2017 and 6.6 percent, to $280.2 million, in 2016. The increase was driven by recent sales activity and steady persistency. See &quot;Premium Collections&quot; for further analysis of Colonial Penn&#x27;s premium collections.</p>
<p>Average liabilities for insurance products, net of reinsurance ceded have increased as a result of growth in the core graded benefit and simplified issue life insurance block in this segment.</p>
