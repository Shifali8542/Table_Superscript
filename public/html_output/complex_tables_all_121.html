<p>1 Amounts include structured trade finance loans held by Federated as well as futures contracts and/or foreign currency forward contracts held within certain consolidated Federated Funds.</p>
<p>2 Amounts include acquisition-related future consideration liabilities as well as certain liabilities attributable to structured trade finance loans held by Federated and may include foreign currency forward contracts and/or futures contracts held within certain consolidated Federated Funds.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Federated did not hold any nonfinancial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2017 or 2016.</p>
<h2>Cash and cash equivalents</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents include investments in money market funds and deposits with banks. Investments in money market Federated Funds totaled $309.1 million and $96.7 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash investments in publicly available money market funds are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices in an active market, which is the NAV of the funds, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. For an investment in a money market fund that is not publicly available but for which the NAV is calculated daily and for which there are no redemption restrictions, the security is valued using NAV as a practical expedient and is excluded from the fair value hierarchy. This investment is included in the NAV Practical Expedient column in the table above.</p>
<h2>Available-for-sale equity securities</h2>
<p>Available-for-sale equity securities include investments in fluctuating-value Federated Funds and are included in Investments-affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For investments in Federated Funds that are publicly available, the securities are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices available in an active market, which is the NAV of the funds, and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. For certain investments in Federated Funds that are not publicly available but for which the NAV is calculated daily and for which there are no redemption restrictions, the securities are valued using NAV as a practical expedient and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These investments are included in the NAV Practical Expedient column in the table above.</p>
