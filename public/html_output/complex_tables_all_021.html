<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p>On September 27, 2016, CEC and CEOC announced that they had received confirmation from representatives of CEOC&#x27;s major creditor groups of those groups&#x27; support for the key economic terms of a consensual restructuring with these constituencies. Under the terms of that deal Apollo funds, TPG and co-investors agreed to contribute the full 14% of the equity (held in the name of Hamlet Holdings) that it would have received under the prior plan through its ownership in CEC. This contribution is valued by CEOC at approximately $950m. Senior creditors (1st lien banks and 1st lien bonds) also agreed to reduce their recoveries vs. the prior version of the plan, in order to facilitate a deal. Under the revised plan, CEOC creditors would own approximately 66% of the fully diluted equity in the combined company (&quot;New CEC&quot;), and shareholders of CAC would own approximately 26% (with public CEC shareholders and management owning the remaining 8% of New CEC). Apollo funds, TPG and Hamlet co-investors (that participated in the CAC transaction in 2013) will collectively own approximately 17% of New CEC once the transactions close.</p>
<p>On October 4, 2016, CEOC filed an amended Chapter 11 plan with the bankruptcy court in Chicago. On January 17, 2017, the proposed plan was confirmed in bankruptcy court. With bankruptcy court approval in- hand, the recent focus has been on implementation of the restructuring and the merger of CACQ and CEC, including regulatory approvals, exit financings, and SEC review of the proposed merger. These processes are expected to be completed in Q3 2017, at which point CEOC will emerge from bankruptcy, CACQ will be merged into CEC, and all pending and potential claims against CEC, CACQ, Apollo, Fund VI and others will be dismissed with prejudice and/or released.</p>
