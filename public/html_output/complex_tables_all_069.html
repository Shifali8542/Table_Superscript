<p>In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment. This guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the amended guidance, a goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This guidance is effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2020, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company&#x27;s consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance that amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements to address both diversity in practice and the cost and complexity of accounting for the change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendment provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard may impact the Company in future periods if modifications are made to certain of its share-based awards.</p>
<p>In July 2017, the FASB issued guidance that addresses narrow issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The guidance becomes effective for the Company in its year ending December 31, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.</p>
