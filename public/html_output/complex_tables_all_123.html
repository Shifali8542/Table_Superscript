<h2>Investment Management Fees</h2>
<p>Investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our SIPs and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of the market value of AUM. Annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. Rates for products sold outside of the U.S. are generally higher than for U.S. products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs.</p>
<p>Investment management fees decreased $112.5 million in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in average AUM and the impact of a lower effective fee rate, partially offset by higher performance fees. Investment management fees decreased $856.1 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a 14% decrease in average AUM and the impact of a lower effective fee rate. The decrease in average AUM in fiscal year 2017 occurred primarily in the global/international fixed income investment objective, and across all sales regions except Asia-Pacific. The decrease in average AUM in fiscal year 2016 occurred in all sales regions and primarily in the global/international and multi-asset/balanced investment objectives.</p>
<p>Our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average AUM) was 59.2, 59.7 and 61.3 basis points for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to higher weightings of AUM in lower fee products in the global/international fixed income investment objective in the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific sales regions, partially offset by higher performance fees. The rate decrease in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to higher weightings of AUM in U.S. products and in lower fee products in global/international investment objectives in the Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific sales regions, partially offset by higher performance fees.</p>
<p>Performance-based investment management fees were $35.5 million, $26.5 million and $19.8 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. The increases in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to performance fees earned from separately-managed accounts.</p>
<p>U.S. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were as follows:</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> U.S. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company, as of September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and include all U.S .- registered open-end funds that reported expense data to Lipper as of the funds&#x27; most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. As defined by Lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. The averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. Variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect higher weightings of two large low fee funds.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 reflect higher weightings of a large low fee fund and lower weightings of two large higher fee funds.</p>
<p>Our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the U.S. industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international AUM, both of which generate higher fees. Our effective investment management fee rates in the U.S. decreased during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, but to a lesser extent than the average industry rates.</p>
