<p>During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 our total quarterly dividend payout was $11.7 million, $10.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively, and were made from retained earnings. See Note 22, &quot;Summary of Quarterly Data (Unaudited)&quot; for further information on quarterly dividends declared on our common stock during the past two fiscal years.</p>
<p>See Note 24, &quot;Subsequent Events,&quot; for information regarding cash dividends declared by our Board of Directors after March 31, 2017.</p>
<h2>Common Stock Warrants</h2>
<p>As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no warrants outstanding. As of March 31, 2015, there were warrants to purchase 4,000 shares of common stock outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $3.00 per share, expiring in fiscal years 2016 through 2017. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we issued 4,000 and 26,000, respectively, shares of common stock upon the exercise of vested warrants at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. During fiscal 2017, we did not issue any shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of vested warrants. In March 2015, the terms of our agreement with Kansas State University Institute for Commercialization were amended and accordingly, the vesting of these outstanding warrants was accelerated. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded expense of $0.2 million related to the vesting acceleration using the Black-Scholes option- pricing model.</p>

<p>For our PSUs, if the performance criteria are achieved during the period, these awards will be considered outstanding for the purpose of computing diluted net income per share if the effect is dilutive. The performance criteria for our PSUs related to FY2017 PSUs, FY2016 PSUs and FY2015 PSUs were achieved during the applicable performance period, fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accordingly, the dilutive effect of the shares were included in the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding.</p>
