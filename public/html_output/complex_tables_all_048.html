<p>and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.</p>
<h2>Net Income Per Share</h2>
<p>Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted average shares outstanding any potential dilutive securities outstanding for the fiscal year. Potential dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan. In fiscal years when a net loss is reported, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive effect, meaning the loss per share would be reduced. Therefore, in periods when a loss is reported basic and dilutive loss per share are the same.</p>

<p>For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 24,000, 62,000 and 2,000 shares of common stock underlying outstanding securities primarily related to out-of-the-money stock options and performance-based awards where milestones were not met were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.</p>
<h2>Stock-Based Compensation</h2>
<p>The Company&#x27;s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, and includes an estimate of awards that will be forfeited.</p>
<p>The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company&#x27;s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual forfeitures, adjusted to the extent historical forfeitures may not be indicative of expected forfeitures in the future.</p>
