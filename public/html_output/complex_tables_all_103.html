<p>Life products include traditional and interest-sensitive life insurance products. These products are currently sold through the Bankers Life, Washington National and Colonial Penn segments. During 2017, we collected life insurance premiums of $782.0 million, or 21 percent, of our total collected premiums.</p>
<p>Interest-Sensitive Life Products. These products include universal life and other interest-sensitive life products that provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return related to current interest rates. They accounted for $181.8 million, or 5 percent, of our total collected premiums in 2017. These products are marketed by independent producers and career agents (including independent producers and career agents specializing in worksite sales). The principal differences between universal life products and other interest-sensitive life products are policy provisions affecting the amount and timing of premium payments. Universal life policyholders may vary the frequency and size of their premium payments, and policy benefits may also fluctuate according to such payments. Premium payments under other interest-sensitive policies may not be varied by the policyholders. Universal life products include fixed index universal life products. The account value of these policies is credited with interest at a guaranteed rate, plus additional interest credits based on changes in a particular index during a specified time period.</p>
<p>Traditional Life. These products accounted for $600.2 million, or 16 percent, of our total collected premiums in 2017. Traditional life policies, including whole life, graded benefit life, term life and single premium whole life products, are marketed through independent producers, career agents and direct response marketing. Under whole life policies, the policyholder generally pays a level premium over an agreed period or the policyholder&#x27;s lifetime. The annual premium in a whole life policy is generally higher than the premium for comparable term insurance coverage in the early years of the policy&#x27;s life, but is generally lower than the premium for comparable term insurance coverage in the later years of the policy&#x27;s life. These policies combine insurance protection with a savings component that gradually increases in amount over the life of the policy. The policyholder may borrow against the savings component generally at a rate of interest lower than that available from other lending sources. The policyholder may also choose to surrender the policy and receive the accumulated cash value rather than continuing the insurance protection. Term life products offer pure insurance protection for life with a guaranteed level premium for a specified period of time - typically 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. In some instances, these products offer an option to return the premium at the end of the guaranteed period.</p>
<p>Traditional life products also include graded benefit life insurance products. Graded benefit life insurance products are offered on an individual basis primarily to persons age 50 to 85, principally in face amounts of $400 to $25,000, without medical examination or evidence of insurability. Premiums are paid as frequently as monthly. Benefits paid are less than the face amount of the policy during the first two years, except in cases of accidental death. Our Colonial Penn segment markets graded benefit life policies under its own brand name using direct response marketing techniques. New policyholder leads are generated primarily from television, print advertisements, direct response mailings and the internet.</p>
<p>Traditional life products also include single premium whole life insurance. This product requires one initial lump sum payment in return for providing life insurance protection for the insured&#x27;s entire lifetime. Single premium whole life products accounted for $45.4 million of our total collected premiums in 2017.</p>
