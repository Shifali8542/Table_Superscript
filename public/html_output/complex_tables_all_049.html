<h2>Fair Value Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:</p>
<p>Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</p>
<p>Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.</p>
<p>Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.</p>
<p>Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.</p>
<p>Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Level 3 is comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Company&#x27;s fair value hierarchy for its financial instruments measured at fair value as of March 31, 2017 and 2016:</p>
