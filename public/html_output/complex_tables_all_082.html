<h2>Item 7. Management&#x27;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<p>The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>We are a fiber broadband and managed IT services provider, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services offering value and exceptional convenience to consumers throughout the state. Our facilities based communications network extends throughout Alaska and connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and we estimate our market share to be less than 25% statewide. However, our revenue performance relative to our largest competitor suggests that we are gaining market share in the markets we are serving.</p>
<p>The sections that follow provide information about important aspects of our operations and investments and include discussions of our results of operations, financial condition and sources and uses of cash. In addition, we have highlighted key trends and uncertainties to the extent practicable. The content and organization of the financial and non-financial data presented in these sections are consistent with information we use in evaluating our own performance and allocating our resources.</p>
<p>We operate in a geographically diverse state with unique characteristics. We monitor the state of the economy in general. In doing so, we compare Alaska economic activity with broader economic conditions. In general, we believe that the Alaska telecommunications market, as well as general economic activity in Alaska, is affected by certain economic factors, which include:</p>
<p>. investment activity in the oil and gas markets and the price of crude oil</p>
<p>· tourism levels</p>
<p>· governmental spending and activity of military personnel</p>
