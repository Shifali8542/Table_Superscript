<h2>Business description</h2>
<p>NCR is a leading camping site operator, renting or owning and operating 15 camping sites across Sweden at the time of investment providing all basic services to its guests such as infrastructure (e.g. waste handling, electricity, restrooms, shower rooms, camping spaces, rental cabins and lodges), facilitating family and recreationally oriented activities (e.g. mini-golf, swimming pools, saunas, boat and bike rental), and small shops and restaurants. The sites include a number of smaller rental lodges, but the majority of the sites&#x27; space is used for housing caravans and RVs. NCR&#x27;s strategy is to grow through acquisitions of new sites primarily within proximity of larger towns or holiday destinations, develop its existing portfolio and exploit economies of scale.</p>

<h2>Investment rationale</h2>
<p>NCR represents an interesting investment opportunity as an attractive platform to expand capacity at existing camping sites and for consolidating the Nordic market, and potentially also outside the Nordic market.</p>
<h2>Transaction description</h2>
<p>A single purpose acquisition vehicle named Nordic Camping &amp; Resort HoldCo AB (previously RCN Interessenter I AB), acquired 100% of Nordic Camping &amp; Resort Holding AB (previously RCN Interessenter II AB), which in turn ultimately will acquire 100% of the shares in the Company through a recommended public cash offer. NCR was previously listed on the Swedish trading platform AktieTorget.</p>
<p>The total investment was SEK 286.5 million (NOK 265.5 million) plus NOK 4.6 million in transaction costs. The transaction was partly financed with a bridge loan facility from the Partnership of SEK 27.3 million (NOK 25.0 million). The Partnership also provided an Expansion Capital Facility of SEK 100.0 million (NOK 91.6 million) to finance potential acquisitions and the proportion of potential expansion investments at existing sites which cannot be financed with bank debt or surplus cash in NCR.</p>
<h2>Exit strategy</h2>
<p>The Investment Manager believes that there are several large players to whom NCR could be an attractive target. Exit opportunities could be one of the following:</p>
<p>· Trade sale to a larger European camping or holiday operator currently not present in Scandinavia</p>
<p>· Sale to a private equity fund with ambitions to further expand the Company in terms of geography and service offering</p>
<p>· IPO</p>
<p>The Investment Manager believes that a trade sale or sale to a private equity fund are the most likely exit routes.</p>
