<p>Changes in Federated&#x27;s average asset mix year-over-year across both asset classes and product types have a direct impact on Federated&#x27;s operating income. Asset mix impacts Federated&#x27;s total revenue due to the difference in the fee rates earned on each asset class and product type per invested dollar and certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size of the customer relationship. The following table presents the relative composition of average managed assets and the percent of total revenue derived from each asset class and product type over the last three years:</p>

<p>Total managed assets represent the balance of AUM at a point in time. By contrast, total average managed assets represent the average balance of AUM during a period of time. Because substantially all revenue and certain components of distribution expense are generally calculated daily based on AUM, changes in average managed assets are typically a key indicator of changes in revenue earned and asset-based expenses incurred during the same period.</p>
<p>Period-end and average managed assets increased 9% and 1%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Period-end money market assets increased 5% at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016. Average money market assets decreased 3% for 2017 compared to 2016. After raising its target funds rate three times in 2017, the FOMC signaled three additional increases are likely in 2018. It also moved to begin its very modest plan to start shrinking the Federal Reserve&#x27;s balance sheet. Period-end equity assets increased 9% at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016 primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net redemptions. Average equity assets increased 11% for 2017 as compared to 2016. Period-end fixed- income assets increased 25% at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of net sales and, to a lesser extent, market appreciation, while average fixed-income assets increased 8% for 2017 as compared to 2016. Equity markets, as measured by the major indexes, continued to set a series of new highs in 2017&#x27;s final quarter, driven by improved earnings, accelerating economic growth and expectations for tax reform legislation that ultimately was approved and signed into law in late December. The bond market saw Treasury yields trend modestly higher over the same three-month period, driven by stronger growth, hints of higher inflation and a general risk-on environment.</p>
<p>Total average managed assets increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Period-end money market assets decreased 2% at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. Average money market assets increased 2% for 2016 compared to 2015. After indicating as many as four short-term interest rate increases may occur in 2016, Federal Reserve policymakers held back, with the FOMC raising the federal funds target rate only once at December&#x27;s meeting to a still accommodative range of 0.50% to 0.75%. Period-end equity assets increased 16% at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to net sales and, to a lesser extent, market appreciation. Average equity assets increased 10% for 2016 as compared to 2015. Period- end fixed-income assets increased slightly at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of market appreciation being nearly completely offset by net redemptions, while average fixed-income assets decreased 3% for 2016 as compared to 2015. During 2016, both equity and fixed-income assets reflected a somewhat volatile year that began with concerns about China and plunging oil prices and ended with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. In between, concerns about China faded, oil prices and the U.S. economy rebounded, and the British delivered another unexpected political outcome, voting in favor of the UK exiting the EU.</p>
