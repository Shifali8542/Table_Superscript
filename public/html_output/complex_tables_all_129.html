<p>On March 12, 2018, the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ was $8.35 per share. As of March 12, 2018, there were approximately 97 record holders of our ordinary shares.</p>
<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>The Company has not paid any cash dividend during the two most recently completed fiscal years. The Company currently intends to retain any earnings for use in its business, for investment in acquisitions and to repurchase shares of its ordinary shares.</p>
<p>As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $52.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. The distribution of funds to shareholders is governed by Israeli law which places certain restrictions on a company&#x27;s ability to declare dividends, perform share buy-backs and make other cash distributions. As an Israeli entity, the Company must comply with those restrictions, which would cause any such cash distribution or use of cash to be subject to significant delays.</p>
<h2>Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans</h2>
<p>The Company is currently granting share-based awards under the shareholder-approved Amended and Restated magicJack VocalTec Ltd. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated magicJack VocalTec Ltd. 2013 Israeli Stock Incentive Plan (together, the &quot;2013 Plans&quot;). The aggregate number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2013 Plans is 5,600,000. The Company had previously granted shares under the VocalTec amended Master Stock Plan (the &quot;2003 Plan&quot;) which expired in April 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued 1,000,000 ordinary share options outside of the 2013 Plans as an inducement for the two founders of Broadsmart to become employed by the Company. These options were all either exercised or forfeited in the year ended December 31, 2017, leaving none outstanding at December 31, 2017.</p>
<p>The following relates to our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2017:</p>
