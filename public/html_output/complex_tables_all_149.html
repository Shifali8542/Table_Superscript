<h2>relevance, and performance of those ads.</h2>
<p>In 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.</p>
<p>Payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. The majority of the decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers.</p>
<p>No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.</p>
<h2>Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue</h2>
<p>The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior year&#x27;s monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017.</p>
<p>The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion and $27.15 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.</p>

<p>2017 Compared to 2016. Cost of revenue in 2017 increased $1.67 billion, or 44%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including content acquisition costs, and ads payment processing.</p>
<p>2016 Compared to 2015. Cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.</p>
<p>In 2018, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.</p>

<p>2017 Compared to 2016. Research and development expenses in 2017 increased $1.84 billion, or 31%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in engineering and other technical functions, partially offset by a $262 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014.</p>
