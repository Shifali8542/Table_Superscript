<h2>Note 23. Subsequent Event</h2>
<p>On September 1, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the &quot;Merger Agreement&quot;) with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (&quot;Valeant&quot;) and Blue Subsidiary Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), pursuant to which Valeant will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of the Company at the following price, each without interest thereon and subject to any applicable tax withholding: (i) $6.50 per share, net to the holder in cash, plus (ii) one non-transferable contractual contingent value right per share, which represents the right to receive up to two contingent payments, if any, of up to $1.00 in the aggregate net to the holder in cash upon the achievement of certain specified milestones within an agreed upon time period (together, the &quot;Offer Price&quot;). Following the completion of the tender offer, Merger Sub will commence a merger (the &quot;Merger&quot;) in which each untendered share of the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, is subject to the tender of a majority of the Company&#x27;s outstanding common stock, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, four putative stockholder class actions were filed challenging the proposed transaction. Three of these actions were filed in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of the State of Missouri and name as defendants all members of the Company&#x27;s Board of Directors, the Company, Valeant and Merger Sub: (i) Murphy, et al. v. Synergetics USA Inc., et al., C.A. No. 1511-CC00778 (filed September 15, 2015 and amended September 23, 2015), (ii) Glorioso, et al. v. Synergetics USA Inc., et al., C.A. No. 1511-CC00803 (filed September 23, 2015) and (iii) Scarantino, et al. v. Synergetics USA Inc., et al., C.A. No. 1511-CC00810 (filed September 28, 2015) (the complaints referenced in (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively the &quot;Missouri Actions&quot;). One of these actions was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and names as defendants all members of the Company&#x27;s Board of Directors, Valeant and Merger Sub: Nilsen, et al. v. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, et al., C.A. No. 11552-VCL (filed September 28, 2015) (the &quot;Delaware Action&quot; and together with the Missouri Actions, the &quot;Actions&quot;).</p>
<p>The Actions generally allege that the members of the Company&#x27;s Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company&#x27;s stockholders by, among other things, conducting a flawed process in considering the transaction, agreeing to an inadequate Offer Price, providing incomplete and misleading information to stockholders, and accepting unreasonable deal protection measures in the Merger Agreement that dissuade other potential bidders from making competing offers. The Actions also allege that Valeant and Merger Sub aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.</p>
