<p>ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)</p>
<h2>14. EARNINGS PER SHARE (Continued)</h2>
<p>Effective in 2015, the Company discontinued use of the &quot;if converted&quot; method in calculating diluted earnings per share in connection with its contingently convertible debt. The Company&#x27;s 6.25% Notes are convertible by the holder beginning February 1, 2018 at an initial conversion rate of 97.2668 shares of common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of the 6.25% Notes. This is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $10.28 per share of common stock. Given that the Company&#x27;s current share price is well below $10.28, the Company does not anticipate that there will be a conversion of the 6.25% Notes into equity. Effective in the first quarter of 2015, the Company determined that it has the intent and ability to settle the principal and interest payments on its 6.25% Notes in cash over time. This determination was based on (i) the Company&#x27;s improved liquidity position subsequent to the Wireless Sale, including its performance against the financial ratios defined under the terms of its then in effect 2010 Senior Credit Facility, reduced levels of debt and increased availability under its revolving credit facility; (ii) its intention to refinance its term loan facility to provide additional borrowing flexibility; and (iii) its expectations of future operating performance. The Company settled the Tender Offer to purchase it&#x27;s outstanding 6.25% Notes for cash on April 17, 2017. See Note 10, &quot;Long-Term Obligations.&quot; Accordingly, 3,371, 9,220 and 10,809 shares related to the 6.25% Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.</p>
<p>The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:</p>

<h2>15. INCOME TAXES</h2>
<p>On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (&quot;TCJA&quot;) was enacted. The TCJA provides for sweeping changes in United States tax rates and tax provisions which will affect the Company as of December 31, 2017 and for periods beginning after January 1, 2018. Effective for years beginning after December 31, 2017, the maximum corporate tax rate will decrease to a flat rate of 21%. This decrease in the tax rate resulted in the remeasurement of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date and resulted in a decrease to existing net deferred tax assets of $3,851. In addition, the TCJA provides for existing Federal AMT tax credits to be refunded from 2018 through 2021. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified existing AMT tax credits of $8,913 from non-current deferred tax assets to non-current long-term tax receivables. The federal AMT credits have been reduced by $569 related to the applicable budget sequestration rate of 6.6%. The Company has evaluated the TCJA and concluded that all information is available to complete the accounting for the effects of the tax reform.</p>
<p>The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. As required by ASU 2016-09, the Company recorded a tax deficiency from share-based payments of $67 in the provision for income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2017, which decreased net income by the same amount. A tax deficiency from share-based payments of $47 in the year ended December 31, 2016 was charged to additional paid-in capital in that period. ASU 2016-09 was adopted on a modified retrospective basis and the income tax provision reported for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were not adjusted for this change. See Note 1 &quot;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&quot; for additional information.</p>
