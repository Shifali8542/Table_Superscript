<h2>Note 3 - Accounts Receivable, Sales and Allowances</h2>
<p>The nature of the Company&#x27;s business inherently involves, in the ordinary course, significant amounts and substantial volumes of transactions and estimates relating to allowances for product returns, chargebacks, rebates, doubtful accounts and discounts given to customers. This is typical of the pharmaceutical industry and not necessarily specific to the Company. Certain rebates, chargebacks and other credits are deducted from the Company&#x27;s accounts receivable where applicable, based on product and customer specific terms. The process of claiming these deductions depends on wholesalers reporting to the Company the amount of deductions that were earned under the terms of the respective agreement with the end-user customer (which in turn depends on the specific end-user customer, each having its own pricing arrangement, which entitles it to a particular deduction). This process can lead to partial payments against outstanding invoices as the wholesalers take the claimed deductions at the time of payment.</p>
<p>With the exception of the provision for doubtful accounts, which is reflected as part of selling, general and administrative expense, the provisions for the following customer reserves are reflected as a reduction of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Additionally, with the exception of administrative fees and others, which is included as a current liability, the ending reserve balances are included in trade accounts receivable, net in the Company&#x27;s consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>Trade accounts receivable, net consists of the following (in thousands):</p>

<p>(1) - The reduction in the Gross accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2017 when compared to the December 31, 2016 balance is due to the decline in Gross sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>(2) - The reduction in the reserve for chargebacks and increase in the reserve for rebates as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 is primarily due to product mix, customer mix, price erosion, volume declines and payment timing. The price erosion and volume declines were due to increased industry pricing pressure and the competitive nature of our business. The rebates processed during full year 2017 are disclosed under the caption &quot;charges processed,&quot; in the table below.</p>
<p>For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded the following adjustments to gross sales (in thousands):</p>
