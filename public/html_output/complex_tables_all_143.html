<h2>Proved Undeveloped Reserves</h2>
<p>As of December 31, 2017, we had 115.1 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (&quot;PUD&quot;) reserves, which is an increase of 17.6 MMBoe, or 18%, compared with 97.5 MMBoe of PUD reserves at December 31, 2016. All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2017, were associated with our core development project, Project Pangea.</p>

<p>Extensions and discoveries relating to proved undeveloped reserves for 2017 were 32.9 MMBoe, primarily attributable to our development of Project Pangea in the Wolfcamp shale oil resource play in the Permian Basin. During 2017, we converted 4.2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, and reclassified 17.7 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves. The reserves reclassified are attributable to horizontal well locations in Project Pangea that are no longer expected to be developed within five years from their initial booking, as required by SEC rules. Revisions included the reclassified reserves, with an increase of 5.6 MMBoe resulting from updated well performance and technical parameters and an increase of 1 MMBoe due to higher commodity prices.</p>
<p>The following table sets forth our PUD reserves converted to proved developed reserves during 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the net investment required to convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves during each year.</p>
