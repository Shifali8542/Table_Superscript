<p>As of December 31, 2017, $39.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefits would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.</p>
<p>We have elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest and penalties included in tax expense was $0.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Our total interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $2.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively. We do not expect any significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve months.</p>
<p>We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and non-U.S. income tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S. federal and the state of California. For U.S. federal and state tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years before 2000. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for years before 2010.</p>
<h2>Note 14. Net Income per Share</h2>
<p>Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock, adjusted for any dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock, computed using the treasury stock method, includes RSUs, MSUs, stock options and our ESPP.</p>
<p>The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stock (in thousands, except per share amounts):</p>
