<h2>Markets Where We Compete</h2>
<p>The primary market in which the Company currently competes is the United States. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 98% of its property and equipment, net of depreciation, is located in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 86% of its consolidated revenues were derived from sales to customers located in the United States. The remaining 14% of consolidated revenues were primarily derived from sales in Canada.</p>
<h2>Business Seasonality</h2>
<p>The Company&#x27;s revenues are not subject to seasonal fluctuations. However, quarterly revenue amounts are impacted by the timing of customer renewals and the revenues for Broadsmart can be impacted by the timing of non-recurring equipment and other sales.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing</h2>
<p>In 2006, the Company entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a Chinese company to manufacture the magicJack devices. Certain components of the magicJack device are built for the Company, based on the Company&#x27;s specifications, in Taiwan and Hong Kong and then sent to the Chinese manufacturer in China for final assembly.</p>
